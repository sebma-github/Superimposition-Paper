**genome_noNW_nomit_GR.rds** can be used with RegioneR if you don't want to use the resampleRegions function.
You can see an example of this at the end of the *Superimposition-Paper/Overlap_Enrichment_Analyses/comparedatasets_regioneR_updated.R* script. 
I do not think it should be used, as the resampleRegions function is, to me, the most accurate. 
But anyway, if you want to use the assembly as a base for other functions, here it is as a GRanges object.
