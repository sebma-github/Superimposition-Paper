**glm27_allPos_noNW_noMit_GR.rds** is a list of all CpGs in the RRBS dataset.

**glm27_signifmorphall_noNW_nomit_GR.rds** is a list of all significant CpGs by morph (Morph, MorphxTime, MorphxSex)

**glm27_nonsignifmorphall_noNW_nomit_GR.rds** is a list of all NON-significant CpGs by morph. You will likely not need this file, as the resampleRegions function does not need the non-significant datasets.

**glm27_signiftimeall_noNW_nomit_GR.rds** is a list of all significant CpGs by time (Time, Time xMorph, TimexSex). You can use this as a negative control.

Morph-specific datasets:
There are no morph specific methylation datasets. Not possible to establish morph congruence with methylation.
