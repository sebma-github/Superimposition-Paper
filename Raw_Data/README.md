Find here the "raw data" behind the superimposition paper.
These are not the sequence files, so they are not quite the raw data. But they are the datasets with which I have been working for this paper, 
and which can be converted to GRanges object for overlap enrichment analysis with the script *Superimposition-Paper/GRanges_Objects/makeGRanges_outofdatasets_no_mit.R*
